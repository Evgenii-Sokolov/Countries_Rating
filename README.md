# Countries_Rating
Countries Rating based on OECD data
Determining the best country is a complex question that depends on the data used, the criteria for comparison, and personal priorities. 
In this project, data has been collected that characterizes the level of development of countries across various aspects of human life. 
The data has been prepared for comparison and the construction of a corresponding ranking. 
Interactive dashboards have been generated as a result of the analysis, which allow for the exploration of a country's development across different aspects and can help identify the best country for an individual based on their preferences.
